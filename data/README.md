-----
This directory contains mouse body fat mass data and its covariates used to perform a QTL mapping.\
 You may use the data for self learning and teaching purposes. However, we would appreciate that you\
 notify us at <jfmedrano at ucdavis dot edu> or <rodrigo dot gularte at ulg dot ac dot be>\
 if you are distributing the data to a class or colleagues.

Plese don't hesitate to send us an email if you have any questions.

SBC_hg2d_pheno.csv
------------------
At the moment contains only body fat data and the covariates used to perform an in-depth QTL analysis\
 on distal mouse choromosome 2.  This is the raw, curated data. The curation process consisted of\
 double checking all the phenotypes for every single individual with our paper records at the moment\
 of the dissection and after finishing with the data input process.

SBC_hg2d_geno.csv
-----------------
This file contains the genotypes of the mice used for the QTL analysis. There are two types of markers\
 microsatellites and SNP.  For microsatellites the midpoint between the start and end positions were\
 used.  All locations are based on Genome build mm9/NCBI_b37.
